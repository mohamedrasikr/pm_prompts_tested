## Tips for Writing Better Prompts

Apply these whether you use prompts from this library or write your own.

### 1. Set the role and audience

Tell the LLM who it is and who the output is for. "You are a senior PM writing for an engineering team" produces vastly different output than no role at all.

### 2. Be specific about format

Not "give me a summary." Instead: "3-5 bullet points, each under 20 words, suitable for a Slack update." Tighter format constraints produce more usable output.

### 3. Provide context, not just instructions

Bad: "Write user stories for a calendar feature."
Good: "Write user stories for a calendar feature in a B2B project management tool. Users are mid-market teams (50-200 people). The calendar should sync with Google Calendar and show project deadlines."

### 4. Use the "do / don't" pattern

Add explicit constraints after your main instruction:
- DO: use concrete metrics, cite the data I provided, flag assumptions
- DON'T: use jargon without defining it, make up statistics, exceed 2 pages

### 5. Ask for reasoning before conclusions

For analytical prompts (prioritization, trade-off analysis), require the LLM to show reasoning before the recommendation. This surfaces flawed logic early.

### 6. Iterate in the same conversation

First drafts are rarely final. Follow up:
- "Make the success metrics more specific"
- "Rewrite the problem statement with more urgency"
- "Add a section on risks"

Faster than crafting the perfect prompt upfront.

### 7. Include examples of good output

Show a snippet of what great looks like. LLMs pattern-match well -- even one example of the tone, depth, and format you want dramatically improves output.

### 8. Use placeholders consistently

Stick to `[BRACKET CAPS]` for user inputs: `[PRODUCT NAME]`, `[TARGET METRIC]`, `[TIME PERIOD]`. Keeps prompts scannable and reusable.
